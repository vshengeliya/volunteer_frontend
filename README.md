Why people volunteer?

1. Meeting like-minded, motivated, positive people is super easy. Connecting over shared passions for a cause while helping others is a great way to meet new friends. By volunteering, your “circle of friends” can get a whole lot bigger in just a short amount of time.

2. Volunteering can offer unique and exciting opportunities. Volunteering as an usher at a theater house, for example, might enable you to see many amazing productions for free. These are pretty cool perks for a couple hours of your time.

3. “Doing good” is important. Volunteering presents a proactive way of doing something to make the world a better place. Even the smallest gestures make a difference. And if we all band together, those small gestures can add up to a big change! 

4. Volunteering creates empowerment. Maybe someone offered you a helping hand when you were down and out. Volunteering gives you the opportunity to pay that favor forward. Often times, a word of encouragement and a little assistance to those in need can help them get back on their feet.

Volunteering has never been easier. Welcome to Volunteer App!
